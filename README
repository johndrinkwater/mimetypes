MIME—Type Examples

The intention of this project is to amass example files of specific mime‐types
to be used for testing mime parsers.

--

Example files are not required — and encouraged not to — have extensions to be
included in this collection as that is a dangerous assumption, but, as it
could potentially be used by a mime parser to suggest the format, at least one
example per mime directory should contain OS‐specific extensions, an example
being .ico for Windows’ ‘image/vnd.microsoft.icon’.

e.g.
├── text
│   ├── plain
│   │   ├── An Example File.txt
│   │   ├── linux-example-file
│   │   └── Poems.text

As many formats exist from an era pre‐Unicode, multiple example files — where
aapplicable — should contain different character sets to better test the parser.

Byte‐order marks should be avoided unless acknowledged in the example file’s
spec. Line‐endings, if used in the example files, should match the platform(s)
the files exist on unless — again — the spec defines a specific behaviour.

Content encoding, such as base64, should again depend on typical behaviour with
respect to the example files being included. Identically, example files should
only be compressed if their format spec supports that. SVG `image/svg+xml`
supports optional gzip-compression, as does tar. These examples should be
included in their respective mime directories, and not within 
`application/gzip`.

For container example files, such as ‘video/avi’, we are not collecting — yet —
exhaustive examples such that would return ‘video/ogg; codecs=theora,vorbis’
from a mime parser.
